                <h4>a) Category</h4>
                <p>
                    Ensure you are familiar with the shop categories in the adplus section in the app,to enable you to determine the appropriate
                    shop category to setup your shop /send your items to.
                    <br/>The shop category is important because it allows you(seller) to upload your items to the appropriate
                    section, grouping all items of the same type together for convenience to app users who may need to buy
                    such items. Choosing the right category allows the app to determine all available features for setting
                    up your shop.
                </p>

                <h4 id="brand-image">b) Brand Image</h4>
                <p>
                    Every shop must have atleast an image by which it should be uniquely identified in the app.This image could be a photo of
                    one of the brand/item you are advertising or selling,or a designed logo for your business or any other
                    pictorial intellectual property. Ensure that you provide a clear logo/brand/shop image of which you can
                    prove ownership if need be.
                </p>

                <h4>c) Promotional Video</h4>
                <p>
                    You can prepare a promotional video to advertise your brand /shop/item.Make sure that the video whenever provided is clear,appropriate
                    and relevant to the purpose.Videos with no clear resolution and quality sound are NOT permissible.Those
                    with inappropriate content SHALL altogether lead to the dissolution of the shop.

                    your products/services through Wottmak in the way you would wish;as they would from a web browser. You

                    more than one image.In our app,we have incorporated features to enable you show more details of your

                    Three".However,you don't need to add details of the extra images i.e for 'Image Two' and 'Image Three'

                    <br/> To add your item,click the 'Add Image' button in the "Add Item" section and select the image you want
                    from your gallery.If you have extra images showing different aspects or features of the item you are

                    the item,proceed to fill up the details of the item you are selling accordingly.
                    <br/>

                    <h6>iii)Pricing</h6>
                    Make sure you distinguish between the old price and the current/new price.The intention of the old price is to show the difference
                    (especially in reduction) in the cost of the item on sale, when compared with its new/current price.
                    Note that it is not mandatory to indicate the old price of the item, if its original price has not been
                    revised or changed.
